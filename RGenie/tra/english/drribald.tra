@0    = ~Do you sell any other items which you don't have on display?~
@1    = ~I have been known to sell a certain service to loyal customers. Keep shopping here at the Adventurers Mart and I might just let you purchase it.~
@2    = ~Hmm your turning out to be quite the regular customer and you look like the sort who would appreciate instant travel to my fair shop from anywhere in the realms. Would you be interested in buying the services of my Genie? It's only 500gp and you can be teleported to the Adventurers Mart and back at any time.~
@3    = ~It's a deal.~
@4    = ~Sorry I don't have enough money at the moment~
@5    = ~No thank you.~
@6    = ~Excellent. Just play this flute and my Genie will appear in front of your eyes to teleport you away. Now I must add that my Genie can't be summoned during combat, one can't risk such a valuable asset can they? Good adventuring to you and be sure to return with plenty of coin.~
@7    = ~Suit yourself.~
@8    = ~Come back as soon as you do.~
